### GoF Design Patterns are divided into three categories:
#### Creational - The design patterns that deal with the creation of an object.
* ✅ [Singleton](src/main/java/com/andeerlb/gof/singleton/README.md)
* ✅ [Factory Method](src/main/java/com/andeerlb/gof/factory/README.md)
* ✅ [Abstract Factory](src/main/java/com/andeerlb/gof/abstractfactory/README.md)
* ✅ [Builder](src/main/java/com/andeerlb/gof/builder/README.md)
* ✅ [Prototype](src/main/java/com/andeerlb/gof/prototype/README.md)

#### Structural - The design patterns in this category deals with the class structure such as Inheritance and Composition.
* ✅ [Adapter](src/main/java/com/andeerlb/gof/adapter/README.md)
* ✅ [Composite](src/main/java/com/andeerlb/gof/composite/README.md)
* ✅ [Proxy](src/main/java/com/andeerlb/gof/proxy/README.md)
* 🕞 [Flyweight](src/main/java/com/andeerlb/gof/flyweight/README.md)
* ❌ Facade
* ❌ Bridge
* ❌ Decorator
