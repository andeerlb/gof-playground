## Proxy
Proxy is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.

## Problem
The Proxy Pattern solves the problem of controlling access to an object by adding an intermediary layer that allows performing additional operations before or after accessing the real object.

## How does it solve these problems?
The Proxy Pattern solves these problems by providing a surrogate object that implements the same interface as the real object but controls access to it
