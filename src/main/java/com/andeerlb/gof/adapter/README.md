## Adapter
Adapter is a structural design pattern so that incompatibles objects can be communicating.

## Problem
To solve the communication between two or more objects, if you need to allow a bunch of objects
to operate together, this pattern solves this, creating an interface to make sure this communication 
happens without noise.

## How does it solve these problems?
You can create an adapter. This is a special object that converts the interface of one object so that another object can understand it.
