## Prototype
It is creational designer pattern that allow cloning objects, even complex ones, 
without coupling to their specific classes.

## Problem
If the cost for creating a new object is expensive  and costs resources.

## How does it solve these problems?
The Prototype Pattern is ideal when object creation is expensive, repetitive, or complex. It helps to:  
✅ Improve performance by reducing instantiation overhead.  
✅ Ensure consistency by cloning pre-configured objects.  
✅ Reduce code duplication and avoid subclass explosion.  
*If you need to create many similar objects dynamically, Prototype is the right choice!*
