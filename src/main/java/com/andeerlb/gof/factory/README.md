## Factory
Is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

## Problem
Factory Method pattern solves the problem of rigid, tightly coupled object creation by providing a flexible and extensible way to delegate instantiation logic to subclasses or specialized methods.

## How does it solve these problems?
The Factory Method pattern solves these problems by introducing an abstraction layer between the client and the object creation process
