## Abstract Factory
Allows the creation of objects without specifying their concrete type. This pattern provides an interface for 
creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes, ensuring that the system is independent of how its objects are created.

## Problem

## How does it solve these problems?

## Abstract Factory VS Factory Method
Abstract factory adds another level of abstraction to factory method. While factory method abstracts the way objects are created, 
abstract factory abstracts how the factories are created. The factories in turn abstracts the way objects are created. 
You will often hear the abstract factory design pattern referred to as a “factory of factories“.
